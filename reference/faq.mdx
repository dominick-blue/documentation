## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Project Dune?">
    Project Dune is an Integrated Research Environment (IRE) that combines paper management, annotation, note-taking, and manuscript writing in one application. It's designed for researchers who want to streamline their workflow from reading papers to writing manuscripts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is Project Dune for?">
    - Graduate students (Masters, PhD)
    - Academic researchers
    - Anyone doing literature-based research
    - Writers who need to manage citations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Project Dune free?">
    Currently, Project Dune is in development/beta and free to use. Future pricing will be announced.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is my data stored?">
    Currently, all data is stored locally in your browser's storage. This means:
    - ✅ Your data stays on your device
    - ✅ No account required
    - ⚠️ Clearing browser data will erase your work
    - ⚠️ Data doesn't sync across devices

    Cloud sync is planned for a future release.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Papers & Library

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What file formats can I import?">
    Currently, Project Dune supports PDF files. Support for other formats (EPUB, web pages) is planned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sync with Zotero/Mendeley?">
    Not yet, but Zotero sync is high on the roadmap. For now, you can export PDFs from Zotero and import them into Project Dune.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why isn't metadata extracted correctly?">
    Metadata extraction depends on the PDF structure. If automatic extraction fails:
    1. Edit the metadata manually during import
    2. Fill in title, authors, and year
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many papers I can import?">
    No hard limit, but browser storage has limits (typically 5-10GB). Large libraries may need cloud storage in the future.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Notes & Writing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is bidirectional linking?">
    When Note A links to Note B, Note B automatically shows a "backlink" to Note A. This creates a web of connected ideas without manual work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I link to another note?">
    Use double brackets: `[[Note Title]]`

    As you type, an autocomplete will suggest matching notes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use LaTeX math?">
    Yes! Use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for block equations:
    - Inline: `$E = mc^2$`
    - Block: `$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there auto-save?">
    Changes are saved when you click the Save button. Automatic saving is planned for a future release.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I collaborate with others?">
    Not yet. Real-time collaboration is on the roadmap for future development.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Citations & Export

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I insert a citation?">
    1. Click the **Cite** button in the drafts toolbar
    2. Search for a paper from your library
    3. Select the paper to insert the citation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What citation styles are supported?">

    Yes! Export your manuscript as LaTeX (`.tex`), then import into Overleaf for final formatting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are my citations not showing in export?">
    Make sure:
    1. Papers are imported in your Library
    2. Citations use correct syntax
    3. A citation style is selected in the export dialog
  </Accordion>
