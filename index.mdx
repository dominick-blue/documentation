## What is Project Dune?

Project Dune is an **Integrated Research Environment (IRE)** that brings together the fragmented tools researchers typically use — from reading papers to writing manuscripts.

## The Research Workflow

Project Dune is designed around a natural research flow:

```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│ COLLECT │ ──→ │  READ   │ ──→ │ CONNECT │ ──→ │  WRITE  │
│         │     │         │     │         │     │         │
│ Import  │     │ Annotate│     │ Notes & │     │ Draft & │
│ papers  │     │ & tag   │     │ links   │     │ cite    │
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
```

Each stage builds on the previous — your annotations flow into notes, and your notes power your writing.
