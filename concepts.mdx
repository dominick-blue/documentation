## Projects

A **project** is the top-level container for all your research materials. Think of it as a folder that holds everything related to a specific research effort.

```
Project: "ML in Healthcare Survey"
├── Library (12 papers)
├── Notes (8 notes)
├── Drafts (2 manuscripts)
└── Code (5 snippets)
```

<Tip>
**Best practice:** Keep projects focused. It's better to have separate projects for distinct research efforts than one giant project with everything.
</Tip>

## The Research Flow

Project Dune is designed around a natural research workflow:

```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│ COLLECT │ ──→ │  READ   │ ──→ │ CONNECT │ ──→ │  WRITE  │
│         │     │         │     │         │     │         │
│ Import  │     │ Annotate│     │ Notes & │     │ Draft & │
│ papers  │     │ & tag   │     │ links   │     │ cite    │
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
```

Each stage builds on the previous:

1. **Collect** — Import PDFs into your Library
2. **Read** — Annotate papers with categorized highlights
3. **Connect** — Create notes that link to papers and each other
4. **Write** — Draft manuscripts with inline citations

## Annotations & Categories

When you highlight text in a paper, you assign it a **category**. This structured approach helps you quickly find and filter insights later.

| Category | Use For | Color |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Key Claim** | Main arguments, findings, contributions | Yellow |
| **Method** | Techniques, approaches, algorithms | Blue |
| **Critique** | Limitations, weaknesses, counterarguments | Red |
| **Definition** | Terms, concepts, frameworks | Green |
| **Question** | Things to follow up, unclear points | Purple |

<Note>
**Why categorize?** When writing, you can filter annotations by category. Need to write your Methods section? Filter for Method annotations across all papers.
</Note>

## Bidirectional Linking

Notes in Project Dune support **bidirectional links** — connections that work both ways.

### Creating Links

Use double brackets to link to another note:

```markdown
This connects to [[Literature Review Notes]]
```

### Backlinks

When Note A links to Note B, Note B automatically shows a backlink to Note A. This creates a web of connected ideas.

```
Note: "Attention Mechanisms"
├── Links to: [[Transformer Architecture]], [[BERT Notes]]
└── Backlinks from: [[Deep Learning Fundamentals]], [[NLP Survey]]
```

### Paper References

Use `@` syntax to reference papers:

```markdown
As discussed in @Smith2024, the approach has limitations.
```

## Citations

Project Dune uses a simple citation workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import papers">
    Add papers to your Library
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open citation picker">
    Click the Cite button or type `@`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search and select">
    Find the paper you want to cite
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose style">
    Select APA, MLA, Chicago, or IEEE
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert">
    Citation appears in your text
  </Step>
</Steps>

Citations are rendered inline and collected into a bibliography on export.

## The Workspace Layout

Project Dune uses a consistent two-panel layout:

```
┌──────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  │                                     │
│    SIDEBAR       │           MAIN AREA                 │
│                  │                                     │
│  - List view     │  - Detail view                      │
│  - Search        │  - Editor                           │
│  - Navigation    │  - Viewer                           │
│                  │                                     │
└──────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Library:** Paper grid (main) with PDF viewer (opens on click)
- **Notes:** Note list (sidebar) with Markdown editor (main)
- **Drafts:** Manuscript list (sidebar) with editor (main)
- **Code:** Snippet list (sidebar) with code viewer (main)
